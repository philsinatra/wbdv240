							Code Quality
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>There are best practices listed under all of the lecture notes sections. Be sure to follow the rules and apply our techniques from class.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>validate your code, there should be no errors (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">validator.w3.org</a>)</li>
								<li>follow the best practices listed on the <a href="general.html">general information page</a> regarding file names, characters and coding styles</li>
								<li>your code is legible and easy to navigate</li>
								<li>your code should use comments wherever possible</li>
							</ul>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Functionality
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Everything needs to work. All links, videos, audio, images, slideshows, rollovers etc. If it's part of your site, it should be working properly.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							Design
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Compare your midterm and your final website. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Does everything look the same? </li>
								<li>Has the design changed? </li>
								<li>If it did, why? </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Enhancements are great. Removing something because you didn’t get around to implementing it or couldn’t figure it out are not valid excuses. If it was in your midterm it should be in your final, unless you have made it better or received written instructor approval prior to week 10.

				<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
				<p>Grading is based upon attendance, class participation, homework assignments, class projects, and a final exam.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html" target="_blank">Attendance is mandatory</a>. Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students are allowed one unexcused absence. If a student has more than one unexcused absence, his or her grade for the course will be reduced one letter grade. If a student has three absences, he or she will receive an F grade.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student&rsquo;s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance. An absence will be excused only if there is documentation verifying the circumstances that caused the absence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Homework Projects, based upon skill sets covered in each lesson, will be due by midnight the night before the following class. Each homework assignment is graded based on technique, creativity and being submitted on time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The dates your assignments are due are indicated clearly in this course outline. Assignments are due on those dates unless you have submitted a written request for an extension at least one class before the assignment is due. <b><u>Late assignments receive 50% points, no exceptions</u></b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Homework and Project grades based upon three criteria, Specifications, Content, and Creativity, broken down as follows:
				</p>
				<h3>Specifications:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Files/e-mails are named appropriately
						<ul>
							<li>Assignments requiring email submission should be sent to your instructors drexel email address from your drexel email address, and use the following format for the subject of the email: <b>wbdv240-s###-hwk##-jhs123</b>. Replace s### with your section number i.e. s001. Replace hwk## with the homework number i.e. hwk01, and replace jhs123 with your email prefix. Submissions not following this format will not filter properly and not accepted. No exceptions.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Assignments meet project size/color requirements</li>
					<li>Assignments are completed on time</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Content:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Homework contains all requested elements</li>
					<li>Quality/Legibility of thumbnails/comps</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Creativity:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Level of detail in thinking</li>
